# Microservices Project

This project is built using a Microservices Architecture to manage product and order-related services independently. It enables asynchronous communication between services, providing flexibility and efficiency in operations.

## Modules

### 1. Product Services
The **Product Services** module is responsible for handling all operations related to products. It includes functionality for:
- Fetching all products
- Creating new products
- Additional product-related operations as needed

### 2. Order Services
The **Order Services** module manages the logic behind ordering products. This module handles:
- Placing orders
- Order management and processing
- Additional order-related operations as needed

## Communication Between Services

The project uses **Asynchronous Communication** for interactions between services, implemented via **Kafka**. This enables non-blocking, event-driven communication, where messages are exchanged without requiring an immediate response, decoupling services and allowing for background processing of tasks.

## API Gateway

An **API Gateway** has been implemented using **Ocelot** to provide a single entry point for all incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate services.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL Server**: Used as the relational database for storing product and order data.
- **Dapper**: Lightweight ORM for handling database connections and operations in a fast and efficient manner.
- **Kafka**: Serves as the message broker for asynchronous communication between services, allowing reliable, decoupled, message-based data exchanges.
- **Docker**: Used to set up and manage the server environment, particularly for the Kafka message broker, ensuring a consistent environment across different development and deployment stages.
- **Ocelot**: Used as the API Gateway to aggregate and route requests to the respective microservices.

## Architecture Overview

The project is divided into modular services, each responsible for a specific business domain. All communication between services is managed asynchronously using Kafka, enabling flexibility, scalability, and resilience.

Each service operates independently, leveraging the benefits of microservices, such as:

- **Scalability**: Each module can be scaled individually based on demand.
- **Resilience**: Independent services ensure that issues in one module donâ€™t directly impact others.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Services can be deployed, updated, or rolled back without affecting the entire application.
- **Centralized API Management**: Ocelot API Gateway provides a unified entry point, simplifying the interaction between clients and microservices.
